I reused the UiPath REFramework and created new project for `UiDemo Level 3 Advance training Assignment`. Some modification done in REFramework are also present the project.

### For New Project ###

1. Check out the Config.xlsx file and add/customize any required fields and values
2. Run `Test_Framework/_test.xaml` to process the transation present in Queue and insert values in UiDemo application.
